# Commit Message: MCP Integration for Bulletproof JSON Handling

```
feat: implement MCP client for bulletproof JSON handling and comprehensive documentation

## 🎯 Overview
This commit implements a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) client to provide 
bulletproof JSON handling for OpenAI responses, ensuring consistent, structured 
output even when the AI model returns malformed JSON.

## ✨ Major Features Added

### MCP Client Implementation
- Add custom MCP client (src/utils/mcpClient.ts) with comprehensive medical analysis
- Implement four progressive JSON parsing strategies:
  1. Direct JSON response parsing
  2. Markdown code block extraction
  3. JSON-like structure pattern matching
  4. Minimal valid structure fallback
- Integrate comprehensive medical knowledge base
- Add Zod schema validation for type-safe JSON handling

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Implement robust fallback mechanisms with automatic retry logic
- Add comprehensive error logging and recovery
- Ensure seamless fallback to direct OpenAI calls if MCP fails
- Provide detailed error messages for debugging

### Technical Improvements
- Enhance TypeScript types with proper type inference
- Optimize JSON parsing algorithms for performance
- Add comprehensive logging throughout the application
- Improve build process and bundle optimization

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture
React App → MCP Client → OpenAI API
     ↓           ↓           ↓
Fallback ← Strategies ← Error Handling

### Medical Knowledge Integration
- Emergency medicine principles (ABCDE approach)
- Common presentations by system (Cardiac, Respiratory, Neurologic, etc.)
- ICD-10 code database with common codes
- Diagnostic and treatment algorithms
