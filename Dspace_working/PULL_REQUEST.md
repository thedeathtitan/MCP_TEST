# Pull Request: MCP Integration for Bulletproof JSON Handling

## 🎯 Overview

This PR implements a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) client to provide bulletproof JSON handling for OpenAI responses, ensuring consistent, structured output even when the AI model returns malformed JSON.

## ✨ Features Added

### MCP Client Implementation
- **Custom MCP Client**: `src/utils/mcpClient.ts` with comprehensive medical analysis logic
- **Bulletproof JSON Strategies**: Four progressive fallback strategies for parsing OpenAI responses
- **Medical Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive medical knowledge integration
- **Zod Schema Validation**: Type-safe JSON validation for all responses

### Enhanced Error Handling
- **Multiple Fallback Strategies**: Direct JSON, markdown extraction, pattern matching, minimal valid structure
- **Robust Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Seamless Fallback**: Automatic fallback to direct OpenAI calls if MCP fails

### Technical Improvements
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript types with proper type inference
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient JSON parsing and validation
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error logging for debugging

## 🔧 Technical Details

### MCP Client Architecture
```
React App → MCP Client → OpenAI API
     ↓           ↓           ↓
Fallback ← Strategies ← Error Handling
```

### JSON Handling Strategies
1. **Direct JSON Response**: Attempts to parse the response as direct JSON
2. **Markdown Extraction**: Extracts JSON from markdown code blocks
3. **Pattern Matching**: Finds JSON-like structures in text responses
4. **Minimal Valid Structure**: Returns a basic emergency assessment structure

### Medical Knowledge Integration
- Emergency medicine principles (ABCDE approach)
- Common presentations by system (Cardiac, Respiratory, Neurologic, etc.)
- ICD-10 code database with common codes
- Diagnostic and treatment algorithms

## 📁 Files Changed

### New Files
- `src/utils/mcpClient.ts` - MCP client implementation
- Updated documentation files

### Modified Files
- `src/utils/openai.ts` - Integrated MCP client with fallback strategy
- `package.json` - Added Zod dependency
- `README.md` - Updated with MCP integration details
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added latest changes
- `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` - Technical implementation details
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Updated project status
